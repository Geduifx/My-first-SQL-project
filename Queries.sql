/*I wanted to get all unique words with their counts from titles to get a better idea on how to group titles. Using google search ‚Äúsql get unique words‚Äù I found a suitable solution, but once I started to implement it, it turned out that MySQL uses SUBSTRING_INDEX function, while I use PostgreSQL which uses SPLIT_PART. Then using google search ‚Äúpostgresql get unique words‚Äù I find a simple solution with REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE. Lesson learned ‚Äì always be specific for which exact tool solution is needed üòä  */
